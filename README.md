## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to:

- Center elements using **Flexbox**.
- Apply **box-shadow** and **border-radius** for modern card designs.
- Use Google Fonts in a project.

Here’s a snippet I’m proud of:

```css
body {
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued Development

I plant to focus more on:

- Improving responsive design skills.
- Writing clean, maintainable CSS.
- Working with CSS Grid in Future challenges.
